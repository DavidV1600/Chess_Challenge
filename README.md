# ATTENTION !!!
THIS PROJECT IS NOT MADE BY ME, only the MyBot.cs file is edited by me, all the credit for the project goes to

I imported all the files of the project so that the user can simply just clone the repo using 
```sh 
https://github.com/DavidV1600/Chess_Challenge.git
```
and then click the start button to experience how my bot plays chess. For all the documentation click <a href="https://seblague.github.io/chess-coding-challenge/documentation/"> here

## About the project
I started this small project because of the challenge Sebastian launched on
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iScy18pVR58"> his youtube channel
  </a> 
  which is basically a contest between small tiny chess bots between people from all around the world. The term small tiny chess bots means that your code for the bot has to not contain more than 1024   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iScy18pVR58"> tokens</a>, which obliges you to write only the most significant things your bot needs to be as good as possible.
